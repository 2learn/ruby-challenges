			<h4>Find a coding group!</h4>
			<p>My advice would be to find a supportive community to get you past the feeling that you don't understand and therefore coding isn't for you. This is just a passing feeling, and it's not real! Coding is for you! One of the best things about it is that coders like to help each other.</p>
			<p>If you have a coding group that meets regularly, this is the best. If you run into problems you can bring the issue to them and they can take a look.</p>
			<p>In addition to solving the problems in your code, the best part of this is that you will sweep a way any doubts you had in your mind about your abilities, because you'll see that it's all about working together.</p>
		
			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
